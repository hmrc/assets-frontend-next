* **design-pattern-library** - This is the generated output of all the components and design pattern partials found in `src`. It's managed by an `npm` build task, can be viewed in a browser, and deployed as a static site to GitHub Pages.
	* **assets** - This directory mirrors the **dist** directory.
* **dist** - Generated JS and CSS ready to be deployed to production.
* **src** - The source files for HMRC frontend assets.
	* **common** - Shared JS and CSS for components and design-patterns.
	* **components** - The building blocks for design-patterns. These consist of at least a view and a stylesheet and may optionally contain a javascript file.
	* **design-patterns** - Reusable collections of components for commonly used parts of pages. These also consist of at least a view and a stylesheet and may optionally contain a javascript file.
* **library-template.html** - This is the template file that the design-pattern-library will be generated from.


## Benefits

* All files and information (markup, styles, scripts, tests, documentation, etc.) are kept together for each design pattern or component which
	* Makes things easier to find, understand, and update
	* Provides a more consistent naming convention - everything is named after the directory
* Using [Nunjucks macros](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html#macro) for design pattern and component templates 
	* Makes them extremely composable
	* Makes them easy to use in a prototype.
	* Makes it simple to transpile them into other templating languages
* Simple build tasks for compiling for various outputs (npm package, deployable production assets, pattern library, partials for play frontends, etc.) means this repo becomes a source of truth for all our design pattern code and their documentation rather than being a one-to-one representation of what gets deployed.

There are also [some slides here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xrbhC7zJC78Ca1ATPaCIH0adAb0onLlHEWNqIW_esMI) that give a comparison of this repo with the current state of our assets.
